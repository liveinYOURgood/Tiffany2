    <h1 class="bodytext">Many years ago I was lucky to meet this wonderful girl off A.O.L. (American Online) and we fast became great friends. I was in NJ and she was out of state. It was a long distance relationship that grew into mutual respectful times. I even got along very well with her mom then. To make a long story short unforeseen circumstances happened and we lost contact. Unfortunately, in this situation, time still moved on without each other. 😢 Hopefully today, she is happy and life is great for her and her family. Now it's 2026 and I still wonder how she's doing? Her name is Tiffany.  </h1>

        <h1 class="bodytext"> Did you ever meet someone that touched your life in a extremely positive way? That situation happened for me then and her name is Tiffany. (in white dress here with friend) After all these years, it would be awesome to know how's she's doing today? That's it, maybe someone will see this that knows her and will pass it along to Tiffany or to her family or friends. My name is Billy (below) and it's nice to meet you. My email link is in the footer below. Think of this website as only a friendly message in a bottle floating down the river of life. 😀 Thank you and God Bless!</h1>

Just a plain old good guy that learned web design recently after a successful past graphic design career. These pictures here of me are recent.

It's a good thing she liked me. haha 😁 "Don't call me Billy, call me Ned.", I replied...(as I thought I was dead, as she would maybe hang up on me then.) But thankfully, it worked, as those names stuck in our playful banter moving forward. </h1>

It was a very bright light in time for me knowing her and today, all I was hoping for is that she is ok and doing great!  It had so much potential and I knew her mom Lisa well too. I wasn't really a stranger. Think of this like a message in a bottle, floating down the river of life and maybe it will land in a happy place to find her or her family and friends to tell her this message inside the bottle...and that is Billy is OK, and I hope you are too.</span></h1>
